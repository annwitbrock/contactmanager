## Contact Management Utility     -    *author Ann Witbrock*
====

This is an app to manage contact lists.
It will help you import your own contacts from your various sources, keep a master list and backup, tidy them up, filter them and export them back to various formats.
If the magic of sync isn't for you, this might be.

**NB This program is not complete**
Expect change.

###The app currently supports :
- **Platforms:** None
- **Import formats:** None
- **Export formats:** None
- **Capability:** None

#### Contributing
- I'll happily look at pull requests for anything on the issues tab, some are intended to be very easy for novice contributers.
- I'll top up the issues list.
- I'll also look at any requests for fulfilling any test that is outlined. I haven't looked them over recently, but consider them 'requirements'. You may need to figure out which is the chicken and egg.
- Be a little patient on response, but if I haven't seen it, do nudge me on once twitter @annwitbrock so I know it's waiting.

#### Testing
To run every test, use the discover option:
```
python -m unittest discover
```
from within the root directory (top project folder).

To run just the system tests:
```
python -m unittest test_system_functions
```

#### Housekeeping
- One issue -> one pull request. Keep it simple.
- Commit small increments of success, with a clear message.
- Merge latest contributions fully into your code before making a pull request. Ask someone if you need help.
- Please make your code technically 'Clean'. Lint and prettify are always helpful too.
- Respect the licensing rights of any code you borrow or any dependency. Include a link or reference to the original source in the commit message. You are responsible for what is initially committed by you.
- Keep all the tests running.

#### Conduct
 - see the wiki. TLDR: be nice, be inclusive.

#### Licencing
- The intention is for this project to remain open source. Maybe we will make a fork to produce a sellable (very cheap) product. From that point, any code from here will be used freely without limitation or obligation - respecting the rights of any dependency it may use.
- No-one may create a patent, copyright or other IP assertion that prevents the use of this code or product design or concept by the contributers, or by anyone who has received a product based on this code and design, at any point in its development.
- A formal standard license will be posted at some point.
- If it looks like we aren't respecting a dependency properly, please do let us know in a helpful way. Thanks.
