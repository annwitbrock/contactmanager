## Contact Management Utility     -    *author Ann Witbrock*
==============

App to import contact lists from various sources, merge and export.

to run the system tests:

```
python -m unittest test_system_functions
```



**NB This program is not complete** 
#### Contributing
- I'll happily look at pull requests for anything on the issues tab, some are intended to be very easy for novice contributers.
- I'll top up the issues list.
- I'll also look at any requests for fulfilling any test that is outlined. I haven't looked them over recently, but consider them 'requirements'. You may need to figure out which is the chicken and egg.
- Be a little patient on response, but if I haven't seen it, do nudge me on once twitter @annwitbrock so I know it's waiting.

#### Housekeeping
- Merge latest contributions fully into your code before making a pull request. Ask someone if you need help.
- Try to make your code as clean as possible before requesting. Linting it is always helpful too. 

#### Licencing
- The intention is for this to remain open source. It maybe we later make a fork for a sellable (very cheap) product. From that point, any code from here will be used freely without limitation or obligation - respecting the rights of any dependency it may use.
- If it looks like we aren't respecting a dependency properly, please do let us know in a helpful way. Thanks.
